# Shoplifting Detection System

Predicting the exact number of items that will be stolen in a shoplifting incident is a challenging task, as it depends on various factors, including the opportunity, the thief's intent, and the effectiveness of the security measures in place. However, you can use the Shoplifting Detection System to detect suspicious behavior and potentially intervene before any items are stolen.

Here's how you can incorporate item prediction into your project:

1. **Object Detection**: Implement object detection within your system. This means recognizing and tracking individual items on the shelves. You can use pre-trained models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN to identify objects in the video feed.

2. **Behavior Analysis**: Combine object detection with behavior analysis. The system can detect when someone is handling items in a way that suggests potential theft. For example, if someone repeatedly picks up an item and hides it in their bag, the system can flag this as suspicious behavior.

3. **Alert Thresholds**: Set alert thresholds based on the detected behavior. For instance, if a person interacts with an item in a suspicious way for a certain duration or in a certain area of the store, generate an alert.

4. **Visual Evidence**: Capture images or video clips when suspicious behavior is detected. This can serve as evidence for store personnel or security to assess the situation.

5. **Notification**: When the system detects suspicious behavior, notify store personnel or security in real-time. They can then assess the situation and take appropriate action.

Keep in mind that predicting the exact number of items stolen may not always be accurate, as not all suspicious behavior leads to theft. However, by implementing these steps, you can create a system that helps prevent theft and provides evidence when shoplifting occurs. Additionally, over time, you can gather data to improve the accuracy of the system's predictions.
